# Design and Configuration of a Secure and Redundant Enterprise Network

This repository documents a group project, focusing on the design, simulation, and deployment of a functional enterprise network using **Cisco Packet Tracer** and real physical equipment.

## ðŸ”§ Project Scope

This assignment (1.5 ECTS) involved planning and building a full network infrastructure for a simulated company. Key tasks included:

- âœ… Determine necessary **VLANs** and implement segmentation
- âœ… Design an IP addressing scheme for all devices
- âœ… Configure routing (static, default, dynamic)
- âœ… Set up inter-VLAN routing and link aggregation
- âœ… Implement **STP** for redundancy and loop prevention
- âœ… Configure **ACLs** to restrict/allow traffic at the correct interfaces
- âœ… Deploy **NAT/PAT** as needed
- âœ… Simulate the network using **Packet Tracer**, then test on physical hardware

## ðŸ‘¥ Group Work & Presentation

- Project completed in groups of 4â€“5 students
- Design phase in **Packet Tracer**, followed by real-world implementation
- Each student was responsible for specific configurations (e.g. routers, switches, ACLs)
- Final presentation and live demo conducted using physical rack equipment

## ðŸ“ˆ Learning Outcomes

- Network design using hierarchical principles
- VLAN planning, trunking, and routing
- ACL writing and security policy enforcement
- Troubleshooting real and virtual environments
- Collaboration in team-based network deployments
